LOCATION

Accepts GeoJSON features containing only one point.

Note that according to the GeoJSON standard coordinates are supposed to be [longitude, latitude ] ([E-W, N-S], in the [-180 - 180, -90 - 90] range). Some other services (such as Google Maps) use coordinate representation in a [latitude, longitude] format and care must be taken to flip the coordinates when interfacing with such services.

Example value:

{
  "value": {
    "type": "Feature",
    "properties": {},
    "geometry": {
    "type": "Point",
    "coordinates": [
       -0.12685775756835938,
       51.43809241973026
       ]
    }
  }
}
